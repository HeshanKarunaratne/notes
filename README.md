- SOLID Principals


- ACID
    - A:Atomicity
        - The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all
        - eg: If T consists of T1 and T2 either T1 and T2 needs to complete or else T will be failed
    - C:Consistency
        - Correctness should be guaranteed
        - eg: Total before T and after T should be equal
    - I:Isolation
        - Transactions occur independently
        - eg: Changes occurring in 1 T should not be visible to other T until committed 
    - D:Durability
        - Once the transaction is committed, the updates and modifications to the DB are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs
